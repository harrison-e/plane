## Description

This program simulates flight through procedurally-generated mesa terrain, with a retro pixelation effect.

This is built off of my final project for CS 4300 Computer Graphics at Northeastern.


## Dependencies

OpenGL, GLM, SDL2

  
## How to run 

Run `python3 build.py` to build. Then, run `./plane`.

## Future updates
- [ ] Add third person perspective
- [ ] Add airplane obj/mtl
- [ ] Add flight physics
